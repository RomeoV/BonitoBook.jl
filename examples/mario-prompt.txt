Can you create a nice looking mario game with WGLMakie?
Use scatter(position, color=sprite) to draw sprites and dont make new plots to animate, but instead update the existing plot..
Use julia exec to make sure everything works.
Make the simple physics engine with gravity and jumping and collision detection with the ground but keep it simple.
Only add a new julia cell to the book after you verified that the code works and does what was requested.
Use !Makie.isclosed(scene) for loop condition.
I attached an image to show you how it should look!
