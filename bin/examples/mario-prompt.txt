Can you create a nice looking mario game with WGLMakie?
Use scatter(position, color=sprite) to draw sprites and dont make new plots to animate, but instead update the existing plot..
Use julia exec to make sure everything works.
Make the simple physics engine with gravity and jumping and collision detection with the ground but keep it simple.
Only add a new julia cell to the book after you verified that the code works and does what was requested.
Use !Makie.isclosed(scene) for loop condition.
I attached an image to show you how it should look!
Use a bare scene, to not have a camera interact with the game.
You should do the whole game logic in Javascript so it stays playable when exported.
Make sure to react to javascript keyboard event to move mario!
Here's an example of how to animate a scatter plot in Makie:
```julia
scene = Scene()
campixel!(scene) # use pixelspace
mplot = scatter!(scene, rand(Point2f, 1000) .* 500;
    color=rand(RGBf, 100, 100), marker=Rect
)
scene

# Direct JavaScript integration with Julia observables
jss = js"""
$(mplot).then(plots=>{
    function update_galaxy() {
        const new_pos = [];
        // create a new position array and update positions
        plot.update([['positions_transformed_f32c', new_pos]]);
    }
});
```
